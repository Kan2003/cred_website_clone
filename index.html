            </h1>

            <p>
                trust as a virtue has consistently played an essential role in every
                great human achievement. and consistently, its importance has been
                overlooked. not just by individuals, but by entire societies. we felt
                it was time someone gave it the spotlight it deserves. especially for
                the ones who live by this virtue: the trustworthy.<br />
                so we thought of creating a system that rewards its members for doing
                good and being trustworthy. this way, trust as a virtue becomes
                something to aspire to, just the way it should be. then we went one
                step ahead: we built it. we know we are on the right track because
                here you are.1<br />
                if you make it to CRED, congratulations and welcome. we have a lot of
                things planned for you.
